- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fronque
My lastname is unsinn which means nonsense in english :) funny, eh?

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things.
(film editing - which is my occupation, music, bicycles, ...) 
I am sorry that I did not learn coding. But it is never to late. Currently I am learning 10 finger typing.
